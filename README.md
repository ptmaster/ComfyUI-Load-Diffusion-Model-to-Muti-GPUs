# ComfyUI-Load-Diffusion-Model-to-Muti-GPUs
I happen to have two graphics cards, and I want to load models into another graphics card in Comfyui, so I designed this small node.
Put the .py file into custom_nodes,in comfyui,seach "Force/Set Loaded Diffusion Model Device" node.
For exsample: You can start your comfyui with GPU 0,and send hunyuan model to pure empty GPU 1 to get the Max frame.
